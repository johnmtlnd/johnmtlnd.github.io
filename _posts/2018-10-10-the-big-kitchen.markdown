description: The Big Kitchen opened its oversized bay doors in 2018 offering Richmonders a brand new way to “do dinner.” Big Kitchen Hospitality, the team behind the popular Tazza Restaurants, has created a prepared meals concept allowing diners to enjoy handcrafted meals in the comfort of their own homes – and without having to get out of their cars.
