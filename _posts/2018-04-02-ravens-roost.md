snippet: Branding and identity for the Cottage at Ravens Roost in Luray, VA.
description: The Cottage at Ravens Roost is a quiet getaway nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. It boasts an authentic coutryside visit, as well as relaxing amenities to make your stay serene and enjoyable. I have helped the cottage update their brand to reflect the mood of the cottage and create a better user experience on their new website.
