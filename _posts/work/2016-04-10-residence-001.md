category: work
---
This is a housing concept that is based on a 3 studios within a home. Work, utility, and leisure are the three studios that make up this housing plan connected with annexes to each facet of living. This softly formed idea has been gelled for over a year of iterations and idea shaping. Below you can see it take form from a napkin sketch to a rough floor plan to some concept renderings of such a house.
