title: Studio House Concept

description: This is a housing concept that is based on a 3 studio concept. Work, utility, and leisure are the three studios that make up this housing plan connected with annexes to each facet of living. The resonance of place-making, space, and how the two interact has become an integral part of my process in design over all practices.
