title: Sight Unseen UI
cover_image: /public/assets/covers/su-cover.jpg
description: Sight Unseen is a sound based horror experience. I worked closely with their game design team to establish a UI that is navigated primarily with sound cues and feedback. This project was a great way to process the amount of accesibility designers put into their work and allowed me to think more in depth about the choices I make when considering the audience of design.
