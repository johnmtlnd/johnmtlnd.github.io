If you're like me (and most other people) then you are always using Spotify in one way shape or form. Often times that involves jamming in the car. Android users are lucky in having options in using Spotify while in the car between Google Auto and Spotify's native "driving-mode" recently released. Since these driving apps are still in early release I anticipate the UX in both forms of the app will improve with time. I often switch between all 3 versions of Spotify mobile to suit my needs while driving safely. Until one version wins me over though, I have taken what I think are the best features of all three user experiences and rolled them into one service called Spotify Auto.
