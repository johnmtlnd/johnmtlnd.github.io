description: Since 2001, Richmond Restaurant Week has been celebrating the city’s diverse food scene while helping give back to the community. While their impact was immense, their brand was in need of a refresh – one that honored the exceptional quality and passion of our city’s world class dining scene. The logo mark was inspired by Richmond’s iconic train bridge and delightfully mimics the silhouette of a table graphically bringing together Richmond Restaurant Week’s two passions, our city and our community.
