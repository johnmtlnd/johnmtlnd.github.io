Ok, I get it. Stop making new portfolio sites. Since I've joined the web in 2009, this site has been designed and re-designed from the ground up and on top of frameworks about seven times. It sounds like I am bragging, but that is NOT a good thing.

But there is more to this site than just the way it looks. A personal website can be so much more than a parking space on the web. Mostly, I want it to be a place to share my ideas separate from the noise of manufactured blog sites. It all begins with the terrifying reality of being out of school and pushing myself to self-improve on my own. I want to share musings, what I am reading, what I am writing, napkin sketches, photographs, and catspotting outings.
