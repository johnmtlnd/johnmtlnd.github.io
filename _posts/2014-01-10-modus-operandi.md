title: Modus Operandi
snippet: Small publication featuring 3 months of data on travel from A to B.
description: Modus Operandi is a small print publication I did while at VCU during three months of data gathering. Everywhere I went, I documented my trip with a sketchbook and pen by dangling the pen over the pages and letting my gait direct its motion. Even by bike, car, and train I did this from September to the beginning of December of 2013. At the end of each trip I collected parameters of each trip like the weather, who I was with and any unique characteristics of my travel on that particular day.
