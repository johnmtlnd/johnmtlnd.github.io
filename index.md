# Hi there â€”


I am John, a designer, front-end developer, and mountain lover living and working in Richmond, VA. Currently I help make design and brands for [Campfire & Co.](http://www.campfireandco.com) I work across disciplines and mediums to create thoughtful and functional design. If I am not hiking and sleeping in the 5-star hotel that is my tent, I am probably engaging in my own personal creative work.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:hello@johnmtlnd.com) or find me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johnmtlnd) to see what I'm up to day to day.
